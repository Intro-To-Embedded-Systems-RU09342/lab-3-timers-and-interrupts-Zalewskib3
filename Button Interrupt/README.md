# Button Interrupt
This code starts with the initialization of which .h file to use, like in every case its MSP430.h, adn the watchdog timer is set to off. The LEDs direction is set to output so we can light it. The interrupt is then enabled at the pin that relates to the button, and then it is set to toggle between the hi and lo edge. After that a pull up resistor is added to the circuit so the charge thats left over when the button interrupt is enabled has somewhere to dissapate. Then the interrupt flag is cleared to make way for a new one. 
The next function is the interrupt service routine, which is an overly complicated if statement. Basically, depending on the compiler it will use different vectors. After this the button is toggled via an XOR gate and it will only work if the button has been pressed. If the button is pressed it sends an interrupt flag to the LED which tells it to stop till the button is pressed again.
