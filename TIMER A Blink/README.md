# TIMER A Blink
Utilizing an updown counter was my solution to this problem. The code is pretty basic, it starts the same way the others do, initializing the .h library we want to use, msp430.h, and we stop the watchdog timer thus stopping an unwanted reset. First we set the direction of the pin we want to use to the out direction to make sure we can get the LED to blink, then we select the option we want on the pin, in this case we are choosing the option of using the primary peripheral. After this, we set the capture and compare register to toggle mode and then we initialize it to 5. Finally, the timer a clock is set to up-down mode by anding the most significant bit of the mux that chooses between the clock with the right bit to yield the up/down clock.
